        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>At Brick and Duck, we believe in the power of storytelling that is both bold and grounded, much like the name we carry. The brick represents the solid foundation of theater: tradition, craft, and structure. The duck, on the other hand, speaks to our free-spirited creativity, humor, and willingness to take flight in new directions. Together, these symbols form a theater company committed to creating productions that challenge, entertain, and stir the soul.

We specialize in works that break conventions, blending the old with the new, and embracing the raw, the real, and the surreal. Our productions explore human nature, relationships, and society—always with an eye for the absurd and a heart for the profound. Whether we’re presenting classic works with a modern twist or creating original plays that spark conversation, we do so with one goal in mind: to make you think, laugh, and feel something you didn’t expect.

Founded by a group of artists who share a deep love for the art of theater, Brick and Duck is more than just a company. It’s a collective space where bold ideas take shape, where creativity has room to grow, and where we invite audiences to join us in questioning, celebrating, and exploring the world through the lens of theater. Come for the brick. Stay for the duck. You’re bound to be surprised by what you find.
